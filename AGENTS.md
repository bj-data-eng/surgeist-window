# Agent Guide

Use this guide for automated work in the `surgeist-window` crate repo.

## Product Compass

Surgeist is a reusable Rust UI framework built around strict, typed, composable primitives for app structure, layout, style, rendering, retained state, text, windows, dialogs, and future template/DSL layers.

Keep Surgeist host-adapter-agnostic unless a crate is explicitly about a host, runtime, or backend. Prefer typed contracts over loose runtime behavior, hidden shared state, or broad framework magic.

Refinement bar:

- Can this API be explained in one paragraph?
- Can this behavior be tested in its owning crate?
- Can this layer be reused outside a single app?
- Can an app override behavior without forking internals?
- Does this boundary reduce coordination, or just move complexity?

Treat public APIs, internals, tests, docs, commands, defaults, and errors as part of the product. Names and boundaries should feel intentional.

## Repository Model

This repo owns the `surgeist-window` crate.

The top-level `surgeist` repo is the facade crate and integration workspace. It links this repo as a submodule under `crates/surgeist-window` and owns workspace wiring, submodule pointers, cross-crate plans, source-derived API coordination, and whole-system verification.

This crate repo owns implementation, focused tests, crate-local plans, crate-local API reports, and the intentional front-door API exposed from `src/lib.rs`.

## Project Boundaries

Use one Codex project for the top-level repo and one Codex project for each crate repo.

Agents working in this crate may edit this crate's source, tests, docs, plans, API artifact, and crate-local tooling. They should run focused checks here before declaring work complete.

Do not casually edit sibling crates or the top-level repo from this crate project. If work requires a sibling API change, stop and report a precise inter-crate issue in that owning repo, or write a complete issue draft if issue creation is unavailable.

Subagents inherit the project boundary they are launched from. Give each worker one clear repo/crate lane. Reviewers may inspect across crates, but implementation workers should stay in their assigned project.

## Crate Role

`surgeist-window` owns window, app host, event-loop, and platform host contracts.

Keep this crate's public API focused on that role. Do not absorb behavior just because another crate needs convenience. If a change would make this crate a dependency sink or introduce a cycle, stop and revisit the boundary with the top-level coordinator.

## Surgeist Crate Map

- root `surgeist`: thin facade, integration surface, and public composition layer.
- `surgeist-css`: strict CSS parsing and lowering into typed style data.
- `surgeist-style`: style model, resolution, and visual/layout property contracts.
- `surgeist-layout`: layout algorithms, layout contracts, oracle/parity tests, and fixture tooling.
- `surgeist-retained`: retained identity, retained state, tree identity, and stable handles.
- `surgeist-text`: text shaping, measurement, font-facing abstractions, and text layout contracts.
- `surgeist-render`: rendering contracts and backend-facing draw data.
- `surgeist-window`: window, app host, event-loop, and platform host contracts.
- `surgeist-dialog`: dialog contracts and dialog coordination primitives.
- `surgeist-shape`: shape, geometry, and primitive path data.

Add crates only for real API boundaries, not architecture theater.

## Dependency Direction

Keep dependencies directional and acyclic. If a small change needs edits across many crates, stop and revisit the boundary.

Current intended shape:

```text
root surgeist crate
  -> surgeist-css
  -> surgeist-dialog
  -> surgeist-layout
  -> surgeist-render
  -> surgeist-retained
  -> surgeist-shape
  -> surgeist-style
  -> surgeist-text
  -> surgeist-window

surgeist-css -> surgeist-style
surgeist-style -> surgeist-layout, surgeist-retained, surgeist-text
surgeist-render -> surgeist-shape, surgeist-window optional
surgeist-text -> surgeist-render optional
```

Plan cross-crate API changes at the top level, then implement crate-local pieces in the owning crate projects.

## API Coordination

API coordination is source-derived only. Do not maintain handwritten API truth tables as authority.

Expose intentional front-door APIs from `lib.rs`, keep internals private by default, and support generated API shape checks when that tooling exists. The top-level repo may consume generated API reports, but source remains the source of truth.

Prefer typed commands, events, snapshots, reports, and change sets. Avoid sibling crates reaching through private module paths, broad common crates that become dependency sinks, and accidental cycles introduced for convenience.

## Type And Value Modeling

Prefer semantic types over broad enums when a distinction carries invariants, units, phases, or API meaning. Use newtypes and focused structs to make invalid states hard to express and call sites easy to read.

Use enums for genuinely closed choices with different behavior, not as catch-all value bags. If an enum starts accumulating unrelated states, revisit the model before extending it.

For values that may stay symbolic across parsing, style resolution, and layout, prefer a generic value representation such as `Calc<T>` over premature conversion to raw numbers. Preserve enough structure to resolve values at the layer with the right context.

## Upstream Issue Reporting

Workers and reviewers may identify issues in sibling or upstream crates while working from this crate repo. They must not edit that crate from the wrong Codex project.

When an upstream issue affects correctness, compatibility, integration, or developer workflow:

- Confirm the owning repo/crate.
- Capture reproduction steps, expected behavior, observed behavior, affected APIs/files, and relevant commands/tests/plans/commits.
- Report the issue in the owning GitHub repo.
- If GitHub issue creation is unavailable, write a complete issue draft in the task output and stop for coordinator action.

Issue reports should be specific enough for a crate-local worker to act without rediscovering the problem. Do not file upstream issues for bugs owned by this crate; fix those locally.

## Plans And Specs

Use Superpowers for workflow guidance. Repo file locations override Superpowers default paths.

Plans go in `/plans` at the root of the repo where the implementation will happen:

- Crate-local plans: this crate repo's `plans/`
- Top-level integration plans: `surgeist/plans/`

If writing specs or design docs, use the same root-local convention unless the user chooses a separate folder. Do not put new plans under `docs/superpowers`.

## Testing

This crate owns its focused test commands. Tight iteration should happen in this crate project.

Expected command pattern:

```sh
cargo test -p surgeist-window
cargo clippy -p surgeist-window --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

Run focused checks before committing. Ask the top-level coordinator to run broader root checks before submodule pointer updates or cross-crate work is declared complete.

## Subagents

Crate coordinators are coordinators first. For implementation work, they assign, verify, reconcile, and integrate; they do not default to doing the code edit themselves.

For any requested code change, a crate coordinator must follow this sequence unless the user explicitly waives it:

1. Confirm the work belongs in `surgeist-window`.
2. Assign one implementation worker to this crate lane.
3. Wait for the worker's result.
4. Assign a separate reviewer to inspect the worker's changes.
5. Reconcile the worker and reviewer findings.
6. Run this crate's focused checks.
7. Hand the completed crate-local result back to the top-level coordinator when root integration or submodule pointer updates are needed.

The coordinator may directly edit crate-local planning, documentation, workflow, or tooling files when the user explicitly asks for that change.

No coordinator may declare implementation complete until a separate reviewer has reviewed the changed code, or the user explicitly waives review.

- Assign one clear repo/crate lane per worker.
- Tell workers they are not alone in the codebase and must not revert others' work.
- Do not duplicate a completed subagent's investigation. Review, verify, reconcile, and act on it.
- Use clean reviewers for code changes, boundary changes, API changes, and nontrivial cross-crate work.

## Editing And Git

- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Prefer `rg` and `rg --files`.
- Check status before and after edits: `git status --short --branch`.
- Do not rewrite unrelated files or revert user changes unless explicitly asked.
- Keep `.venv/`, `target/`, `build/`, `dist/`, secrets, host identity, editor residue, and runtime residue out of git.
- Commit logical points with short, concrete messages.

Commit in the repo being changed:

- crate implementation commits inside this crate repo
- submodule pointer and integration commits inside the root Surgeist repo

Never silently edit a sibling crate or the top-level repo from this crate project and call it done. If that happens by mistake, stop, report it, and reconcile deliberately.
